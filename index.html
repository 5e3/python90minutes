<h5>The Project: A (Jelly) Bean Counter</h5>
This program should help you keep track of how many jelly beans you have left as you eat them (or M&Ms, or whatever). It should first ask the user, one time, how many jelly beans they have. Then keep asking them how many jelly beans they ate, and tell how many there are left, until there are no more left. Sample output:

<div class="boxed">
<pre>
How many jelly beans do you have to start with? 50
 How many jelly beans did you just eat? 23
 After you ate those 23 jelly beans, you only have 27 jelly beans left.
 How many jelly beans did you just eat? 12
 After you ate those 12 jelly beans, you only have 15 jelly beans left.
 How many jelly beans did you just eat? 11
 After you ate those 11 jelly beans, you only have 4 jelly beans left.
 How many jelly beans did you just eat? 4
 After you ate those 4 jelly beans, you only have 0 jelly beans left.
You are ALL OUT of jelly beans.</pre>
</div>

<p>1. Start out by looking at the example program, which shows how a while loop works and how an if statement works. Hit the play button to run it. Also review the examples in the reference sheet. 
<p>2. Then move on to the trinket with the starer code for bean counter. It is incomplete and will not run, and needs you to fix several lines to get it working. The lines that start with a hash sign # are comments. Compare to the example and the reference sheet, and look at the comments to deduce how to write each line so that it does what it is supposed to. 
<p>3. If you get it working, then add an if statement at the end to print out a different message depending on whether the last input results in a bean count of zero, or less than zero (which I guess would be a form of jelly bean debt?). If you get done with that, then help your neighbors to get their program working. 
<p>4. If you reload the page, you will go back to the original starter code. If you want to preserve your code at any point, click the "share" button (the sideways "V") and choose "link", and note the new URL you get.
