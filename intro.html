<p><h3>JMSG: 90 Minutes of Python, February 26</h3>

<h5>Meet Joe, and Python</h5>
<b>Joe.</b> <ul><li>I was a programmer, now a lawyer.<li> I taught one section of computer science at Skyline HS for a year. <li>I still enjoy writing the occaional program.</ul>
<p><b>Python.</b> Python is the programming languge we are using today.<ul>
<li>Originally designed as a simplified teaching languge
<li>Now the second most popular language in industry, after javascript
<li>Examples are that the Dropbox clients are written entirely in Python
<li>Like most programming languages, uses text to give instructions to the computer
<li>There are lots of Python <i>interpreters</i> but today we will be using Trinket.io because you can just use it in a web browser without a login. Programmers use it to test things and show each other code demos.
</ul>

<h5>Concept Review and Overview For Today</h5>

<ul>
<li>Review (or learn for the first time) some <a href="./pyref.html">definitions</a>
<li>Today we are going to be using (1) while loops; (2) data types and <i>casting</i>; (3) getting user input; and if you have time then (4) if/then statements.
<li>Computers are very particular about <i>syntax</i>. They take things literally. A lot of what you will be doing today is seeing "Syntax Error", which means the computer doesn't understand the form of your code. Check against the examples very carefully.
<li>Indentation is important in Python. The computer knows where you are in a control structure (if or while block) based on indentation, so that can mess you up. 
<li>Copying is bad in most subjects, but not always in programming. The best ways to learn are to take examples and modify them until they do what you want. 
<li>It's often a little frustrating when you are starting out because you get error after error. But eventually it works and it's a big HOORAY! Keep looking at the line numbers in the errors, which will tell you <i>where</i> the problem is even if you can't quite tell <i>what</i>the problem is. 
</ul>
