# python90minutes
This is a few pages I used to teach a ~90 minute class in Python to kids (this is probably good for 8th-12th) who had done some Scratch coding but no previous Python. 
The interpreter interface I used here is trinket.io
Here's a manifest of the files:
    index.html - contains an overview of the problem to be solved, which is a jelly bean counter. The user gives a number of beans, and then a while loop repeats, asking the user how many beans they ate. When the number of beans is zero, the while loop condition is satisfied, and it exits. 
    pyref.html - an overview of some Python basics and examples. The main one students will need for the bean counter problem is the while loop and type casting. 
    intro.html - a quick overview I used to introduce myself and python
